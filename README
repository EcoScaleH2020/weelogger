1. Intro
~~~~~~~~
Weelogger was created out of the need to have a compact, lightweight and modular logging library.
All libraries that I found were either too monolithic and primitive or way too complex.

2. Design
~~~~~~~~~
The inspiration was Boost::Log's design. At the centre of the library is the core (thread-safe, if enabled).
The core should stay as compact as possible. The only thing that is predefined in the core are the logging levels.
The other components are modules that can be inserted as needed.
Attributes prepend some user-defined information to the string. Examples would be: date, time, PID.
Sinks are responsible for writing the output stream to the device of choice. The default sinks included with the
distribution are stdout sink and file sink.
The user is free to develop and add as many attributes and sinks as one would like.

3. Build
~~~~~~~~
The build system is made of 1 plain vanilla makefile. In order to build the library and tests, create an empty
directory anywhere on your system. Then type `make -f <path_to_weelogger_dir>/Makefile`.
This will build by default just the static and dynamic libraries. The only header file that needs to be included 
is the wl_logger.h.
The C++ wrapper can be found in the cpp folder. It is built as a part of the default build.
The tests are scarce at the moment and can be found in the folder apps. The test build targets are basic_test, file_test,
cpp_test.

4. Use
~~~~~~
The library is licensed under LGPL v3.
For usage examples check the apps directory.
